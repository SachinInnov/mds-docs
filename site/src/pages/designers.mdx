The Masala Design System provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable React components, css with dynamic theming support and static markup to develop user interfaces using design system principles and guidelines. This enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.

Reset Styles
As BEM is used reset.css is not used and no style reset is done.

Polyfill for IE
For css variables to work on IE we use a polyfill at runtime to achieve dynamic theming through variables. Please add the following polyfill in your page.

## Installing component library

Run the following command using npm to add the component library to your project.

## Adding styles

As this component library is part of a framework-agnostic design system used at Innovaccer the styling is done with CSS using CSS variables for theming and BEM methodology for reusable and modular styling. So it requires you to include CSS in your project by either importing or serving it as a static file. The complete stylesheet is published as part of the component library at path @innovaccer/design-system/css.
