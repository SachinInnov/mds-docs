Mobile page for Designers
Run the following command using npm to add the component library to your project.

## Adding styles

As this component library is part of a framework-agnostic design system used at Innovaccer the styling is done with CSS using CSS variables for theming and BEM methodology for reusable and modular styling. So it requires you to include CSS in your project by either importing or serving it as a static file. The complete stylesheet is published as part of the component library at path @innovaccer/design-system/css.
